## Task Tracker

Hello Everyone! <br />
I made this application as an effort to continue my daily habit and continue coding.
This is in an effort to make sure that I can have a productive day.

### Getting Started

Open the following link in your browser<br />
[https://cjara002.github.io/taskTracker/](https://cjara002.github.io/taskTracker/)

This application uses your local storage to store your task for the day. No one else should be able to view your task.

### Edit, Delete, Update Task

You can edit , delete, or update your task as needed. <br />
I have written an algoritm in the background that will allow you to interact with your task.

### Chrome Webscrapper and Quotes

I used Google Chrome's Webscrapper to get mutiple motivational quotes. Quotes can be found on the lefthand side of the application. You should see a brand new quote every time you refresh the page.

### Contact Me

I strive for progress not perfection.<br />
As such, I would like to hear from you if you have any suggestions for this application.
I can be reached on LinkedIn [www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-j-jara](www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-j-jara).
